A `stream cipher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher>`_ developed by Andrew Garcia based on catalogued shuffled keyboards. 

A cipher is an encryption algorithm and thus, can be applied to program development in
any language. Originally developed in Python and optimized to C++ as **streamdice**. 
The JavaScript implementation **streamdiceJS** was written to integrate to websites as an interactive application.
