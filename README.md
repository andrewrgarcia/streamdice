# streamdice

streamdice is a [stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) developed by Andrew Garcia based on the catalogued  random shuffling of keyboard hashmaps. 

A cipher is an encryption algorithm and thus, can be applied to program development in 
any language. [**Streamdice**](./streamdice) and [**streamdiceJS**](./streamdiceJS) are the C++ and web (JavaScript) implementations of this cipher, respectively.
